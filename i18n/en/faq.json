    "a": "The basic principle of cold therapy is simple – cooled air is directed at an injured area. Basically, it works as a cold compress but in a much more effective way. Applying cold air to an inflamed area is a well-known method and it is completely safe."

    "q": "Do i need liquid nitrogen ?",
    "a": "The technology is not based on using liquid nitrogen to perform cryotherapy. You will not need it first because in this device the air is cooled with the help of electricity. The operating principle is based on a high volume of cooled air – there is no need for liquid nitrogen."
